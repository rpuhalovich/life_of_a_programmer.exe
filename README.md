# life_of_a_programmer.exe

## Introduction

This is a game that was made as the second assignment for the COMP30019 subject at the University of Melbourne over the course of six weeks.

life_of_a_programmer.exe is a game set as the imaginary hyperbolic stereotype of what it is like to be an everyday programmer. The story is that you are a programmer running through code trying to catch a bug at the very end of the level (code) in the shortest time possible.

In accordance with the code running metaphor, the game has you parkour your way through obstacles over the course of several levels, each of which has a bug. In particular, you are able to double jump, dash, grapple, launch from boostpads and wall run to navigate.

Throughout the game you will see many references to common programming concepts. To name a few, each level is named after a common programming error (save for the tutorial, 0_hello_world.lvl), the tutorial controls are defined in array notation, the main menu is a terminal and of course, the end goal is to catch the bug.

## Getting Started

**_NOTE: The game is only to be played in a 16:9 aspect ratio in the game view. The UI is not designed for any other aspect ratio as is specified in the project settings!_**

After cloning the repository and opening the project in Unity, open `Assets/Scenes/Menu/Open Screen` to begin. The tutorial level is 0_hello_world.lvl and introduces each of the mechanics gradually.
